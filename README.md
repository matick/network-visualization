network-visualization
=====================

A graph/network visualization using vis.js library

Click the "Reset" button, to start the network visualization. There's a sample test object included in the code.

It is recommended to use the contained version of vis.js, because it is slightly modified. In this version of vis.js the label is shown in the center of Node, when the Node is of shape "dot". Whereas in the stock version the label is shown below the "dot" Node.
